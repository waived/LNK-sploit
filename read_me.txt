      LNK SPLOIT V1.0
////////////////////////////

Thank you for using LNK-Sploit! 

Objective: to bypass Windows MOTW (Mark of the Web) regulated by Windows SmartScreen.
           Each malicious .lnk shortcut file this program generates will act as a 
           trojan downloader. It will silently download and execute a payload of the
           user's choice. It is recommended that any payload downloaded/executed has
           some sort of instance control (ex- process Mutex) in the event the victim
           spam-clicks the .lnk file out of frustration, confusion, etc.

By downloading, modifying, distributing, or using this program, the end user agrees
to the included legal statement outline in the included LEGAL.txt file.
