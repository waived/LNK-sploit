      LNK SPLOIT V1.0
////////////////////////////

Thank you for using LNK-Sploit! 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Objective: 
           Bypass Windows MOTW (Mark of the Web) regulated by Windows SmartScreen.
           Each malicious .lnk shortcut file this program generates will act as a 
           trojan downloader. It will silently download and execute a payload of the
           user's choice. It is recommended that any payload downloaded/executed has
           some sort of instance control (ex- process Mutex) in the event the victim
           spam-clicks the .lnk file out of frustration, confusion, etc.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Technical information:
            Payload customization lies mainly within two categories:
                1) FILENAME: customized filename upon download

                2) LOCATION: the payload can be downloaded to these directories:
                        - Downloads
                        - Favorites
                        - Application Data
                        - Temporary Files
                        - User Profile
